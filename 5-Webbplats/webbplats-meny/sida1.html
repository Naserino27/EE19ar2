        <p>Suicideboys (stylized as $uicideboy$) is an American hip hop duo from New Orleans, Louisiana, founded in
            2014 by cousins Ruby da Cherry and Scrim (stylized as $crim). Via the music sharing platform SoundCloud,
            the duo rose to popularity for their abrasive, self-produced beats, as well as their harsh lyrical
            content and themes prominently featuring substance use disorder and suicidal ideation. They own and
            operate their own label, G*59 Records, under which all of their music is distributed by Caroline
            Distribution.</p>
        <p>The duo are considered one of the most popular acts in the underground rap scene, and are also considered
            to have a cult following. After several years of solely releasing EPs and mixtapes, Suicideboys' debut
            studio album I Want to Die in New Orleans was released on September 7, 2018. It fared well commercially,
            becoming their first top-ten album on the US Billboard 200. In May 2019, they released their
            collaborative six-track EP with Blink-182 drummer Travis Barker entitled Live Fast, Die Whenever. It
            also prominently featured Korn guitarist James Shaffer.</p>
