        <p>Gustav Elijah Åhr (November 1, 1996 – November 15, 2017), known professionally as Lil Peep (often stylized as
            LiL PEEP), was an American rapper, singer, songwriter and model. He was a member of the emo rap
            collective GothBoiClique. Helping pioneer an emo revival style of rap and rock music, Lil Peep has been
            credited as the leading figure of the mid–late 2010s emo rap scene and came to be an inspiration to outcasts
            and youth subcultures.
            Distribution.</p>
        <p>Born in Allentown, Pennsylvania, and raised on Long Island, New York, Lil Peep started releasing music on
            SoundCloud in 2014, using the pseudonym Lil Peep because his mother had called him "Peep" since he was a
            child. He soon became popular on the platform for his collaborations with Lil Tracy and several mixtapes:
            Lil Peep; Part One (2015), Live Forever (2015), Crybaby (2016) and Hellboy (2016); the latter's success led
            him to his first solo tour across the United States.</p>
