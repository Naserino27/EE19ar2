        <p>Eric Whitney (born April 15, 1991), professionally known as Ghostemane or alternatively as Baader-Meinhof,
            Swearr, Limsa Lominsa or GASM, (formerly iLL BiZ) is an American rapper, singer, and songwriter. Originally
            growing up in Florida, Ghostemane started out playing in local hardcore punk and doom metal bands. He moved
            to Los Angeles, California after starting his career as a rapper.</p>
        <p>Ghostemane's merging of rap and metal gained him popularity on SoundCloud. In 2018, Ghostemane released his
            seventh studio album, N/O/I/S/E, which was highly anticipated in the underground music scene due to its
            heavy influence from industrial and nu metal groups.</p>
