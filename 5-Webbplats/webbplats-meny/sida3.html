        <p>King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard are an Australian rock band formed in 2010 in Melbourne, Victoria. The band
            consists of Stu Mackenzie (vocals, guitar, bass, keyboards, flute), Ambrose Kenny-Smith (vocals, harmonica,
            keyboards), Cook Craig (guitar, bass, vocals), Joey Walker (guitar, bass, keyboards, vocals), Lucas Harwood
            (bass, keyboards), and Michael Cavanagh (drums, percussion). They are known for exploring many different
            genres, staging energetic live shows and building a prolific discography, having released fifteen studio
            albums, two EPs and four live albums since the band's formation.</p>
        <p>Their second EP, Willoughby's Beach (2011), and debut album, 12 Bar Bruise (2012), primarily blended surf
            music and garage rock, and were released on Flightless, the band's own independent record label. Their
            second album, a "psychedelic western audiobook" titled Eyes Like the Sky (2013), features narration by
            Broderick Smith. Float Along – Fill Your Lungs, released later in the year, and the 2014 albums Oddments and
            I'm in Your Mind Fuzz, saw the band expand on their psychedelic sound. In 2015, they drew on elements of
            jazz fusion and progressive rock with Quarters!, and also released the folk-inspired Paper Mâché Dream
            Balloon, recorded almost entirely using acoustic instruments. Nonagon Infinity (2016), arguably their most
            acclaimed album to date, features nine interconnected tracks that form an infinite loop, and won the ARIA
            Award for Best Hard Rock or Heavy Metal Album.</p>
